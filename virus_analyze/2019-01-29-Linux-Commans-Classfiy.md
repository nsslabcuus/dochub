### Linux commands classfy

**updated date**

* 04/12/2019 Update the table and the linux command to each scripts link.

I have counted all of the commands which are the Linux commands in our bash malware scripts. There are only 112 Linux commands used in these 1784 bash scripts.

There are two links to the result.

- [commands_linux.json](https://github.com/guozetang/IoT-Malware-Dataset-App/blob/master/commands_linux.json)
- If you want to know which files use the each command, please access the link. [commands to each scripts file](https://github.com/guozetang/IoT-Malware-Dataset-App/blob/master/command_to_file.json)

The second one sorted by the count number. In addition, I have put the commands table as followed.
